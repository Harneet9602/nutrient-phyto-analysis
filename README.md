 ðŸŒ± Nutrient and Phytoplankton Biomass Analysis

This Jupyter Notebook contains data exploration and visualization of two environmental datasets:
 Nutrient concentrations (e.g., NH4N, NO2N, NO3N, TN)
 Phytoplankton biomass across groups like Cyanophyceans, Chlorophyceae, and others

 ðŸ“‚ Datasets Used
 `NutAverage.xlsx`: Nutrient concentration data
 `PhytoBiomass.xlsx`: Phytoplankton biomass data
 Data sources are provided via public URLs in the notebook

This project is part of my Data Science learning journey. It helped me practice:

 Data cleaning and feature engineering
 Pandas DataFrame operations
 Plotting multiple types of visualizations
 Interpreting scientific environmental data
